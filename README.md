# Google Maps Data Visualization



### Project Description:
Google Maps Data Visualization as the name suggests is a data visualization project on geographic data. This project locates all the crimes happening in Baltimore city on the Google Maps (created by using Maps Javascript API) with the help of unique criminal marker icon. 
The icon indicates where on the map of the Baltimore city, crimes are committed. By clicking on those criminal markers, it will display all the details of the crime 
committed in an information window. One can close the window by clicking the close option if the information is done viewing. Clicking the marker also opens the 
street view (created by the Google Street View API) on the right panel to get a view of the street where the crime was committed.

This project can be a part of a bigger project which utilizes this information of what all crimes are happening around a particular area of Baltimore. It can be helpful for
a potential home buyer to choose a house in more safe area, or it can be useful to the investigators/new case investigators to get the details of the crime and have a look at
street where the crime was committed and reach the main site to do further investigations, or to simply be alert of the surroundings.
 
For this project Crime dataset is used from the US government for Baltimore, Maryland. It has details like the date and time of the crime, crime code (helpful information for police and investigators), 
crime description (e.g. assault, robbery, etc), location of the crime which are mapped on the Google maps using the coordinate information.  
This project can be further extended to all the cities of United States or all the cities across the globe.
